Our TOxic links scanner not just tells you which of your hyperlinks are suspicious but it will also show your where exactly those links located. It detects spam, pharm, and other harmful links and helps you remove them.

== Description ==

Having spam links on your site can affect your Google rank positions and their existence may cause some real damage to your online business as well as to your reputation on the Internet! 
Having spam and malicious links can really affect your business:
Lose some of the existing customer base (current users sooner or later will get confused enough to never come back)
Get problems with getting new customers (because of the harmful links and redirects visitors simply won't be finding information and pages they are looking for).
Damage your reputation online (most of the online customers consider links to porn, gambling, pharm as a demonstration of no respect to them from the site's owners)
Have negative impact on your website's ratings with major Search Engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing etc
Sometimes, itâ€˜s enough just to have one malicious or fraudulent link on your site to get penalized by Google. With the help of compromised websites, cybercriminals can redirect visitors and spread various malware programs, so you can lose your reputation and visitors because of one link on your website.
